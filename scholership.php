								At Loyola, we believe that every human being who wants a great education is entitled to one. It is our stated philosophy that no one who is deserving will ever be refused admission due to their financial constraints. And so, over the years, with the help of many generous sponsors, including kid alumni, we have instituted several grants and aids.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition, Loyola also believes in rewarding extraordinary accomplishments in college (and outside), and so we have several scholarships for high performers.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the year 2014 the management decided to award 307 scholarships to extraordinary performers. The total scholarship amount added up to Rs. 15.5 Lakhs.
							</p>
					        <p>
						Loyola's scholarships/grants, then, broadly fall under 4 categories:
