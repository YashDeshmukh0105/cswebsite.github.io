							Social Extension activity is the important third limb of University Education along with teaching and research. Loyola Academy Degree and P.G. College in its efforts to lay stress on this aspect has undertaken ambitious social programs and an attitude of compassionate concern in students is strengthened by this Extension Programme - PLANET (Projects of Loyola Academy for Neighborhood, Empowerment and Transformation).The objective of this programme is to inculcate among the students the spirit of Social responsibility besides Academic excellence and Spiritual growth as they are encouraged to strive for acquiring more knowledge and skills through different courses, they are also exposed to stark social realities of rural and urban poor and to develop in them an attitude of deep concern for the neglected section of our society.

The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ (Mat 25:40).

In line with the mission of our college to mold, ‘Men and Women for Others’, PLANET PROGRAMME makes it mandatory for all the first year degree students to participate in social service extension activities. This academic year too the first year students have worked with lot of NGOs and Govt. organizations and came back with indelible memories.

Our students and staff conduct various drives under the Planet Program. The drives are intended to raise awareness about cleanliness & hygiene, blood donation, helping the poor, and many other noble causes.
